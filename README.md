# ðŸš€ Git Automate Script
A simple Bash script that automates the process of initializing a Git repository, committing changes, and pushing them to a remote repository. 
It's useful for quickly setting up and syncing a local project with GitHub, GitLab, or any other Git hosting service.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Initializes a new Git repository if one doesn't exist.
- Adds and commits all changes in the project directory.
- Automatically ignores the script itself (gitAutomate.sh).
- Sets up a remote repository and pushes to the main or existing branch.

## ðŸ“– Usage
- Run the script and add the remote repository URL
```
./gitAutomate.sh https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```
